      <h2>About ScrumBoard</h2>
      <p>
        ScrumBoard is a comprehensive tool designed to enhance the agility and productivity of software development
        teams. With ScrumBoard, you can visualize your project's workflow using a flexible board with five distinct
        columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Review, and Done. This intuitive layout allows for easy organization and
        prioritization of tasks, enabling your team to focus on what's crucial at every stage of development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features at a glance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Management:</strong> Effortlessly create tickets with essential details such as title,
          description, assignee, tags, and estimated effort. The drag-and-drop functionality ensures seamless transition
          of tasks across different stages, reflecting the updated status instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Environment:</strong> Multiple team members can be assigned to a ticket, encouraging
          collaboration. With the detailed view, you can delve deeper into each ticket, editing titles, descriptions,
          and tracking the actual hours spent versus the estimated efforts.</li>
        <li><strong>User Roles and Permissions:</strong> A robust user management system empowers admins to create
          users, assign roles, and manage permissions with granularity â€“ from editing and moving tickets they are part
          of, to managing all aspects of any ticket within the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> Users can create accounts with secure credentials, ensuring that
          their activity is appropriately tracked and managed. The login mechanism is streamlined for ease of access
          while maintaining security protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Admin Oversight:</strong> Admin users hold the key to the kingdom, with the ability to alter user
          rights, manage all tickets, and adjust the system to align with evolving project requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ScrumBoard is more than just a tracking tool; it is the central hub for your project's planning, execution, and
        reflection. Welcome aboard and prepare to see your team's efficiency soar!
